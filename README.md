# TwitchVods
A console app which pulls all of the past broadcast data from the Twitch.tv API and creates webpages from the data.

The app is built using .Net CORE 2.0.

You will need to specify your own settings in a settings.json file. An example one is included in the project.

You will also need a Client-ID from twitch to use this and specify it in the settings.json file. Read about the Client-ID here:
